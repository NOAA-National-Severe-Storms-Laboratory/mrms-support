The read_mrms_binary program will read a MRMS binary file and dump relevant
information to the terminal.  It is meant to...
 
 1. provide documentation,
 2. show how to read 2D and 3D data, 
 3. serve as a framework for making your own converter program or custom 
    read function  

It does not convert data or have any output other than messages to the
terminal. 

For further documentation of the MRMS binary format see...
ftp://ftp.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/MRMS/MRMS_BINARY/MRMS_Gridded_BinaryFormat.pdf


To Compile:	g++ -o read_mrms_binary read_mrms_binary.cc -lz

Usage:  read_mrms_binary /path/input_file swap_flag
        swap_flag = 0 or 1; see read_mrms_binary.cc header for more info
